# Movies-App

This is a fully functional android app which I made from scratch for Developing Android course which i took with  [MAL] (https://www.mobileapplaunchpad.com.eg) (Mobile Application Launchpad) which is a scholarship program between MCIT and Google to teach 2000 participants how to be a professional Android Developers. 
 
# Features
With the app, you can:

•	Discover the most popular, the highest rated movies.

•	Save favorite movies locally to view them when offline.

•	Watch trailers.

•	Read reviews.

• Preview it on both Mobile and Tablet.

# How to Work with the Source
This app uses The Movie Database [(TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org) API  to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to: app/build.gradle
