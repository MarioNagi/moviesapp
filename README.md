# Movies-App

This is a fully functional android app which I made from scratch for Developing Android course which i took with MAL (Mobile Application Launchpad) which is a scholarship program between MCIT and Google to teach 2000 participants how to be a professional Android developers. 

# Features
With the app, you can:
•	Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
•	Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
•	Watch trailers
•	Read reviews

# How to Work with the Source
This app uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API  to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to: app/build.gradle
